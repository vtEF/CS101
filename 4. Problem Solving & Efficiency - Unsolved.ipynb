    "## Space and time\n",
    "\n",
    "When we refer to the efficiency of a program, we aren't just thinking about its speed—we're considering both the time it will take to run the program and the amount of space the program will require in the computer's memory. Often there will be a trade-off between the two, where you can design a program that runs faster by selecting a data structure that takes up more space—or vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithms\n",

    "*An algorithm is essentially a series of steps for solving a problem. Usually, an algorithm takes some kind of input (such as an unsorted list) and then produces the desired output (such as a sorted list).*\n",
    "\n",
    "For any given problem, there are usually many different algorithms that will get you to exactly the same end result. But some will be much more efficient than others. To be an effective problem solver, you'll need to develop the ability to look at a problem and identify different algorithms that could be used—and then contrast those algorithms to consider which will be more or less efficient.\n",

    "Sometimes it seems like computers run programs so quickly that efficiency shouldn't really matter. And in some cases, this is true—one version of a program may take 10 times longer than another, but they both still run so quickly that it has no real impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in other cases, a small difference in how your code is written—or a tiny change in the type of data structure you use—can mean the difference between a program that runs in a fraction of a millisecond and a program that takes hours (or even years!) to run.\n",

    "Suppose that we analyze an algorithm and decide that it has the following relationship between the input size, **n**, and the number of operations needed to carry out the algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "$N = n^2 +5$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Where **n** is the input size and **N** is the number of operations required.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we gave this algorithm an input of 22, the number of required operations would be $2^2 +5$ or simply 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are some other possible values for the input (*n*). For each input, what does $n^2 + 5$ evaluate to?\n",
    "\n",
    "Options: 10005, 630, 105, 30\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Input 5 - Number of Operations - ? \n",
    "2. Input 10 - Number of Operations - ? \n",
    "3. Input 25 - Number of Operations - ? \n",
    "4. Input 100 - Number of Operations - ? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The thing to notice in the above exercise, is this: In $n^2 + 5$, the 5 has very little impact on the total efficiency—especially as the input size gets larger and larger. Asking the computer to do 10,005 operations vs. 10,000 operations makes little difference. Thus, it is the $n^2$ that we really care about the most, and the $+5$ makes little difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the time, when analyzing the efficiency of an algorithm, the most important thing to know is the order. In other words, we care a lot whether the algorithm's time-complexity has a linear order or a quadratic order (or some other order). This means that very often (in fact, most of the time) when you are asked to analyze an algorithm, you can do so by making an approximation that significantly simplifies things.\n",

    "## Efficiency practice\n",

    "One of the main goals of this lesson is to help you develop your ability to look at some code and identify its time complexity—and then describe this time complexity using Big O notation.\n",
